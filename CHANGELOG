1.3.1
 - Bugfix: hashes nested in regexp params could get through unfiltered

09/12/2009
----------
* Restructured and reorganized.  Now the majority of the work is done in the Protector class.  This minimizes the amount of methods / instance variables that clutter the controllers.
* The filtering is done in ActionController::Base#params now, instead of as a before filter.  This eliminates the caveat of before filters declared after param_protected/param_accessible calls having access to the unprotected params.

09/11/2009
----------
* Refactored tests to use plugin_test_helper.
* gemified

03/17/2009
----------
* more sane way to specify nested parameters (honestly, I don't know what I was thinking before)
* the old method of specifying nested parameters ("user/first_name", "user/last_name") DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE.
* changed param_protected/param_accessible's :exclude argument to :except to better fit in with Rails

07/16/2008
----------
* rewrote the entire plugin (it should actually work now)
